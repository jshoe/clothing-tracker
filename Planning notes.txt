- 2015-01-16: Definitely some sort of bug in the "Next shorts" function since it returned like jeans to me instead of looping around to the next wear_count level.
- 2015-01-09: Adjust wear counts and wash settings for your AE jeans (or keep to a separate load).
- 2014-12-27: A lot of these to-dos I'll probably just ignore.
- 2014-12-20: Make max wear counts an individual field in each item, so that you can set your jeans to have 4 wears before washing. Fix yet another bug in Clothing Tracker apparently on the Merona Polo part?
- 2014-11-15: Add "Days left of Shirts" (done).
- 2014-10-30: Big things to implement: tee-polo randomization, skip functionality
- 2014-09-13: Don't forget to get the jackets to display properly in the app.
- 2014-09-04:
    - Add basic jacket-shirt color matching (or avoiding matching)
- 2014-09-04:
    - Figure out how to export to .exe
- 2014-08-31:
    - Need to redo the clothing pick algorithm so that it's random (so that it doesn't always go in the same order)
- 2014-08-29:
    - Replace more numerical commands with letters (done)
- 2014-08-27:
    - Add in your jackets and other outerwear
- 2014-08-15:
    - Add a skip / 'next' function to return the second-optimal one (done)
- 2014-07-22: Extra things you could do:
    - Making sure the program can handle it when certain fields are empty. Also if there's no match found after sorting by soil wear and wear date.

    - Get the print_inventory output to be sorted in some way.
    - Support extra properties, long pants, outerwear.
    - Clean up code and add comments.
    - id_num checker / management.

Notes:

dictionary format:
    Fields: Name of the clothing item, List of dates worn
    Methods: last_worn_date(), worn_count_since_wash()

openning():
    Read from the JSON file and do a straight convert into a dictionary.

Main interface:
    Welcome to the clothing tracking program. The day is Sunday, July 20, 2014.

    Enter the number of the item of clothing you want to wear or enter 0 to exit.

    LIST OF CLOTHES

    >>> user input (and verification of input)

    Enter the number of the item of clothing you want to wear or enter 0 to exit.


    IF 0, then write to the JSON file and exit.


Things to do:
    - Add a "favorite categories" functionality, e.g. the categories of clothing that the app will pick from each day automatically :P.
    - Add a "you will need to do laundry by" feature, in days and in the date.
